Machine Learning Model 1:

Balanced Accuracy was 95%
Precision and Recall for predicting healthy loans was 100% and 99% respectively.
Precision and Recall for predicting high risk loans was 85% and 91% respectively.
Machine Learning Model 2:

Balanced Accuracy was 99%.
Precision and Recall for predicting healthy loans was 100% and 99% respectively.
Precision and Recall for predicting high risk loans was 84% and 99% respectively.


Summary

The analysis provides us with enough information to effectively predict healthy lending with the use of supervised machine learning. Random oversample of the data improves balanced accuracy. Both models were precise in predicting loans. Both models also were very precise in predicting loans, even though alse positives and false negatives could be costly in the loss of precision in predicting high risk loans.
